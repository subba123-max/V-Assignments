Q)difference between compiler and interpreter?
compiler:-
===========
1.Compiler scans the whole program in one go.	
2.	As it scans the code in one go, the errors (if any) are shown at the end together.	
3.	Main advantage of compilers is itâ€™s execution time.	
4.	It converts the source code into object code.
5	It does not require source code for later execution.	
Eg.	C, C++, C# etc.

Interpreter:-
-----------
1.Translates program one statement at a time.
2.Considering it scans code one line at a time, errors are shown line by line.
3.Due to interpreters being slow in executing the object code, it is preferred less.
4.It does not convert source code into object code instead it scans it line by line
5.It requires source code for later execution.
Eg.	Python, Ruby, Perl, SNOBOL, MATLAB, etc.

Q)what is strongly typed and loosely typed languages?
Strongly Typed Programming Languages:-
-------------------------------------
Strong typing in computing are used when a programmer has to put more than once restrictions in a programme in any operation, which are to be executed on different declared data types with different values. In strongly typed languages, every variable defined in a code has been be well defined and assigned with data type.
loosely Typed Programming Languages:-
----------------------------------
A loosely typed language is a programming language that does not require a variable to be defined. For example, Perl is a loosely typed language, you can declare a variable, but it doesn't require you to classify the type of variable. In the example below, the first line declares the $test variable that can be used as an integer or string.
